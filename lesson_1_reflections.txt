How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having the previous versions of a project, we can see what changes were made
    with course of time. Thus, we can return to any previous version if some
    update fails after some updates.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    For automatic saving like in google docs, there may be too many unnecessary
    changes saved, or even perhaps too much of a change. For manual commit, we
    know exactly the right time, and when we should stop and commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Well, it depends on the end user
